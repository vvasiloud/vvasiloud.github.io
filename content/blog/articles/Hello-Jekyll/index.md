Hello Jekyll, Hello World! 
Decided to give up Wordpress for personal blogging for good giving Jekyll a try here in <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.

As far as now I can tell:

  * Templating with <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="blank">Liquid</a> is nice
  * Easy setup in <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>
  * By nature it's a static generator, no more security worries for the paranoid  O_O ...

Happy Jekyll blogging!
