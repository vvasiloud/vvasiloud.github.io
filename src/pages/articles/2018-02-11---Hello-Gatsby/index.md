Since I am more confortable writing in Javascript that Ruby decided to move from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Gatbsy](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for my personal
blogging.

I was kind overwellmed by broken ruby gems and weired errors, so I took the decision for the move. Of course I had to put some 
effort migrating and leaving my favorite theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) in favor of [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). With small customizations 
to adjust some parts I loved from the previous theme to it, and in the end I came up with something very similar :P...
The process was really straightforward and in the meantime I had some introduction to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) since
I have an [Angular](https://angular.io/) background. Playing with [React](https://reactjs.org/) was easier than I thought!.

I am going to miss some great features of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) e.g {% if page %} but I think I can bear with it.
