Of course I had to put some\neffort migrating and leaving my favorite theme <a href=\"https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\">Minimal Mistakes</a> in favor of <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\">Lumen</a>. With small customizations\nto adjust some parts I loved from the previous theme to it, and in the end I came up with something very similar :P…\nThe process was really straightforward and in the meantime I had some introduction to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> and <a href=\"http://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> since\nI have an <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> background. Playing with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> was easier than I thought!.</p>\n<p>I am going to miss some great features of <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> but I think I can bear with it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Moving to Gatsby","date":"February 11, 2018","description":"Hello Gatsby, Goodbye Jekyll :/ ...","thumbnail":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/Hello-Gatsby/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/articles/Hello-Jekyll/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello Jekyll"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/portfolio/anna-kristina/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kristina Annamukhamedova"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
